## Overview

Fenn Agritech is a UK-based B2B agritech SaaS company headquartered in Bristol. The platform provides crop and field management software to independent commercial farms across England and Wales with a customer base of approximately 1,000 farms. Fenn is Series B funded and employs around 100 people.

## Founding Context

Fenn was founded in 2019 by Zoe Cooper-Hartley (CEO) and Cian Kelly (CTO). Zoe brings a background in organic farming policy from her years in the UK organic certification sector, having grown up on a US Midwest farm before moving to the UK. Cian was previously a tech lead at a UK challenger bank, where he led work on cryptographic key management and customer-controlled data access. The platform was built in response to two converging pressures on UK farming: the Agriculture Act 2020, which replaced EU farm payments with new support schemes and gave government powers to collect agri-food supply chain data, and the accelerating push from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) toward digitizing farm operational data. Fenn operates under the tagline "Your land. Your data. Your decision," a commitment to building tools that prioritize the operational autonomy and data sovereignty of working farmers, free from surveillance-default infrastructure.

## Product

Fenn's platform integrates field operations tracking, compliance record-keeping, sustainability reporting, weather and soil sensor integration, accounting and drone survey integration, and AI-driven yield forecasting. The product is delivered through web and mobile applications, with in-cab equipment display integration via direct API integrations to the major UK farm equipment manufacturer cloud platforms (John Deere Operations Center, CNH FieldOps for Case IH and New Holland, AGCO FarmENGAGE, CLAAS connect) and ISOBUS-compatible in-cab terminals.

## Customers

Fenn serves approximately 1,000 UK crop farms. Fenn's software is designed to be compatible with Soil Association organic certification record-keeping requirements, and its reporting formats are designed to align with major UK retailer sustainability programmes.

## Technology and Vendors

Fenn's production infrastructure runs on Amazon Web Services in the London region. Farm data is protected through encryption with customer-held keys, ensuring farm data remains inaccessible to Fenn and its infrastructure providers without explicit customer authorization. Internal collaboration is standardized on Proton (email, file storage, calendar, password management) for end-to-end encrypted employee communications.

## Regulatory Posture

Fenn's primary regulator is the Information Commission (ICO) for UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 compliance. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) governs workplace safety. Fenn's product features intersect with Defra agricultural schemes and National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) cyber security guidance, though Fenn itself is not directly regulated by either body.

## Incident History

In November 2024, an attacker stole an access key from one of Fenn's sub-processors and used it to copy account data (names and email addresses) and encrypted farm operational data, which stayed unreadable. The [Post-Incident Review](https://fenn.wichman.io/trust-center/post-incident-review-november-2024) (FENN-RPT-001) sets out what happened and what Fenn changed.

## Current State

Fenn's GRC documentation is built to demonstrate readiness for Cyber Essentials Plus and ISO 27001:2022 certification. The Series B closed in October 2025, with the security and compliance team scaling following the round. Jack Lowe joined as Head of Security in January 2026 to lead ISO 27001 readiness work.
